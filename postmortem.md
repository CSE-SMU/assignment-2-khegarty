# Assignment 2 Postmortem

## How difficult was this assignment?
I spent a combined 8 hours over the weekend and on Monday looking up how to use the different parts of css. The project itself was not difficult once I figured out how things works, but figuring it out took quite a long time. 


## Did you learn anything new from this assignment?
I learned a ton of new things from this assignment, I feel fairly confident in manipulating classes in css. 


## Did you use any of the links provided in the homework? If so, which ones?
I used the link that explained for overflow(although I did not find it personally helpful) as well as the shapes link for the notch in the hair, which was quite helpful. 



## How could this assignment be improved?
I think the pseduo vectors should have been stressed a little more in class, they were fairly difficult to google. Also, the overflow link was not very good at explaining overflow, and I'm not entirely sure I used it correctly, so you could reevalute the website or introduce it in class, both would be helpful!


## Any other comments?
The transition between the first two assignments in terms of intensity was pretty good, I didn't feel overwhelmed by either.
